  abstract     = {We study stochastic zero-sum games on graphs, which are prevalent tools to model decision-making in presence of an antagonistic opponent in a random environment. In this setting, an important question is the one of strategy complexity: what kinds of strategies are sufficient or required to play optimally (e.g., randomization or memory requirements)? Our contributions further the understanding of arena-independent finite-memory (AIFM) determinacy, i.e., the study of objectives for which memory is needed, but in a way that only depends on limited parameters of the game graphs. First, we show that objectives for which pure AIFM strategies suffice to play optimally also admit pure AIFM subgame perfect strategies. Second, we show that we can reduce the study of objectives for which pure AIFM strategies suffice in two-player stochastic games to the easier study of one-player stochastic games (i.e., Markov decision processes). Third, we characterize the sufficiency of AIFM strategies through two intuitive properties of objectives. This work extends a line of research started on deterministic games to stochastic ones.},

  abstract     = {Reachability objectives are arguably the most basic ones in the theory of games on graphs (and beyond). But far from being bland, they constitute the cornerstone of this field. Reachability is everywhere, as are the tools we use to reason about it. In this invited contribution, we take the reader on a journey through a zoo of models that have reachability objectives at their core. Our goal is to illustrate how model complexity impacts the complexity of strategies needed to play optimally in the corresponding games and computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {In two-player zero-sum games on graphs, the protagonist tries to achieve an objective while the antagonist aims to prevent it. Objectives for which both players do not need to use memory to play optimally are well-understood and characterized both in finite and infinite graphs. Less is known about the larger class of half-positional objectives, i.e., those for which the protagonist does not need memory (but for which the antagonist might). In particular, no characterization of half-positionality is known for the central class of ω-regular objectives. Here, we characterize objectives recognizable by deterministic Büchi automata (a class of ω-regular objectives) that are half-positional, both over finite and infinite graphs. This characterization yields a polynomial-time algorithm to decide half-positionality of an objective recognized by a given deterministic Büchi automaton.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies two-player zero-sum games played on graphs and makes contributions toward the following question: given an objective, how much memory is required to play optimally for that objective? We study regular objectives, where the goal of one of the two players is that eventually the sequence of colors along the play belongs to some regular language of finite words. We obtain different characterizations of the chromatic memory requirements for such objectives for both players, from which we derive complexity-theoretic statements: deciding whether there exist small memory structures sufficient to play optimally is NP-complete for both players. Some of our characterization results apply to a more general class of objectives: topologically closed and topologically open sets.},

  abstract     = {We study the memory requirements of Nash equilibria in turn-based multiplayer games on possibly infinite graphs with reachability, shortest path and Büchi objectives. We present constructions for finite-memory Nash equilibria in these games that apply to arbitrary game graphs, bypassing the finite-arena requirement that is central in existing approaches. We show that, for these three types of games, from any Nash equilibrium, we can derive another Nash equilibrium where all strategies are finite-memory such that the same players accomplish their objective, without increasing their cost for shortest path games. Furthermore, we provide memory bounds that are independent of the size of the game graph for reachability and shortest path games. These bounds depend only on the number of players. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first results pertaining to finite-memory constrained Nash equilibria in infinite arenas and the first arena-independent memory bounds for Nash equilibria.},
