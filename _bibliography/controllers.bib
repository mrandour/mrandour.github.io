  abstract     = {We study stochastic zero-sum games on graphs, which are prevalent tools to model decision-making in presence of an antagonistic opponent in a random environment. In this setting, an important question is the one of strategy complexity: what kinds of strategies are sufficient or required to play optimally (e.g., randomization or memory requirements)? Our contributions further the understanding of arena-independent finite-memory (AIFM) determinacy, i.e., the study of objectives for which memory is needed, but in a way that only depends on limited parameters of the game graphs. First, we show that objectives for which pure AIFM strategies suffice to play optimally also admit pure AIFM subgame perfect strategies. Second, we show that we can reduce the study of objectives for which pure AIFM strategies suffice in two-player stochastic games to the easier study of one-player stochastic games (i.e., Markov decision processes). Third, we characterize the sufficiency of AIFM strategies through two intuitive properties of objectives. This work extends a line of research started on deterministic games to stochastic ones.},

Objectives for which both players do not need to use memory to play optimally are well-understood and characterized both in finite and infinite graphs. Less is known about the larger class of half-positional objectives, i.e., those for which the protagonist does not need memory (but for which the antagonist might). In particular, no characterization of half-positionality is known for the central class of ω-regular objectives. Here, we characterize objectives recognizable by deterministic Büchi automata (a class of ω-regular objectives) that are half-positional, both over finite and infinite graphs. This characterization yields a polynomial-time algorithm to decide half-positionality of an objective recognized by a given deterministic Büchi automaton.},

We study regular objectives, where the goal of one of the two players is that eventually the sequence of colors along the play belongs to some regular language of finite words. We obtain different characterizations of the chromatic memory requirements for such objectives for both players, from which we derive complexity-theoretic statements: deciding whether there exist small memory structures sufficient to play optimally is NP-complete for both players. Some of our characterization results apply to a more general class of objectives: topologically closed and topologically open sets.},

We present constructions for finite-memory Nash equilibria in these games that apply to arbitrary game graphs, bypassing the finite-arena requirement that is central in existing approaches. We show that, for these three types of games, from any Nash equilibrium, we can derive another Nash equilibrium where all strategies are finite-memory such that the same players accomplish their objective, without increasing their cost for shortest path games. Furthermore, we provide memory bounds that are independent of the size of the game graph for reachability and shortest path games. These bounds depend only on the number of players. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first results pertaining to finite-memory constrained Nash equilibria in infinite arenas and the first arena-independent memory bounds for Nash equilibria.},

Optimal strategies may require randomisation when dealing with inherently probabilistic goals, balancing multiple objectives, or in contexts of partial information. There is no unique way to define randomised strategies. For instance, one can use so-called mixed strategies or behavioural ones. In the most general settings, these two classes do not share the same expressiveness. A seminal result in game theory - Kuhn's theorem - asserts their equivalence in games of perfect recall. This result crucially relies on the possibility for strategies to use infinite memory, i.e., unlimited knowledge of all past observations. However, computer systems are finite in practice. Hence it is pertinent to restrict our attention to finite-memory strategies, defined as automata with outputs. Randomisation can be implemented in these in different ways: the initialisation, outputs or transitions can be randomised or deterministic respectively. Depending on which aspects are randomised, the expressiveness of the corresponding class of finite-memory strategies differs. In this work, we study two-player turn-based stochastic games and provide a complete taxonomy of the classes of finite-memory strategies obtained by varying which of the three aforementioned components are randomised. Our taxonomy holds both in settings of perfect and imperfect information, and in games with more than two players.}

We study the structure of the set of expected payoff vectors of all strategies given a multi-dimensional payoff function and its consequences regarding randomisation requirements for strategies. In particular, we prove that for any payoff for which the expectation is well-defined under all strategies, it is sufficient to mix (i.e., randomly select a pure strategy at the start of a play and committing to it for the rest of the play) finitely many pure strategies to approximate any expected payoff vector up to any precision. Furthermore, for any payoff for which the expected payoff is finite under all strategies, any expected payoff can be obtained exactly by mixing finitely many strategies.}

We study a fundamental class of infinite MDPs: one-counter MDPs (OC-MDPs). They extend finite MDPs via an associated counter taking natural values, thus inducing an infinite MDP over the set of configurations (current state and counter value). We consider two characteristic objectives: reaching a target state (state-reachability), and reaching a target state with counter value zero (selective termination). The synthesis problem for the latter is not known to be decidable and connected to major open problems in number theory. Furthermore, even seemingly simple strategies (e.g., memoryless ones) in OC-MDPs might be impossible to build in practice (due to the underlying infinite configuration space): we need finite, and preferably small, representations.
To overcome these obstacles, we introduce two natural classes of concisely represented strategies based on a (possibly infinite) partition of counter values in intervals. For both classes, and both objectives, we study the verification problem (does a given strategy ensure a high enough probability for the objective?), and two synthesis problems (does there exist such a strategy?): one where the interval partition is fixed as input, and one where it is only parameterized. We develop a generic approach based on a compression of the induced infinite MDP that yields decidability in all cases, with all complexities within PSPACE. }

The rate of such an embedding is defined as the ratio n/N. It is well known in the literature how to construct isometric embeddings with a rate of Ω(1logn). However, achieving even near-isometric embeddings with a positive constant rate has remained elusive until now.
In this paper, we present an isometric embedding with a rate of 1/8 by discovering connections to synchronization strings, which were studied in the context of insertion-deletion codes (Haeupler-Shahrasbi [JACM'21]). At a technical level, we introduce a framework for obtaining high-rate isometric embeddings using a novel object called misaligners. As an immediate consequence of our constant rate isometric embedding, we improve known conditional lower bounds for various optimization problems in the edit metric, but now with optimal dependency on the dimension.
We complement our results by showing that no isometric embedding φ:{0,1}n→{0,1}N can have rate greater than 15/32 for all positive integers n. En route to proving this upper bound, we uncover fundamental structural properties necessary for every Hamming-to-edit isometric embedding. We also prove similar upper and lower bounds for embeddings over larger alphabets.
Finally, we consider embeddings φ:Σnin→ΣNout between different input and output alphabets, where the rate is given by nlog|Σin|Nlog|Σout|. In this setting, we show that the rate can be made arbitrarily close to 1. }

We consider solving games played on temporal graphs where one player aims to explore the graph, i.e., visit all vertices. The complexity depends majorly on two factors: the presence of an adversary and how edge availability is specified.
We demonstrate that on static graphs, where edges are always available, solving explorability games is just as hard as solving reachability games. In contrast, on temporal graphs, the complexity of explorability coincides with generalized reachability (NP-complete for one-player and PSPACE- complete for two player games). We further show that if temporal graphs are given symbolically, even one-player reachability and thus explorability and generalized reachability games are PSPACE-hard. For one player, all these are also solvable in PSPACE and for two players, they are in PSPACE, EXP and EXP, respectively.}

A major challenge is that the optimal consensus ranking might be biased against individual candidates or groups, especially those from marginalized communities. This concern has led to recent studies focusing on fairness in rank aggregation. The goal is to ensure that candidates from different groups are fairly represented in the top-  positions of the aggregated ranking.
We study this fair rank aggregation problem by considering the Kendall tau as the underlying metric. While we know of a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the classical rank aggregation problem, the corresponding fair variant only possesses a quite straightforward 3-approximation algorithm due to Wei et al., SIGMOD'22, and Chakraborty et al., NeurIPS'22, which finds closest fair ranking for each input ranking and then simply outputs the best one.
In this paper, we first provide a novel algorithm that achieves  -approximation (for any  ), significantly improving over the 3-approximation bound. Next, we provide a  -approximation fair rank aggregation algorithm that works irrespective of the fairness notion, given one can find a closest fair ranking, beating the 3-approximation bound. We complement our theoretical guarantee by performing extensive experiments on various real-world datasets to establish the effectiveness of our algorithm further by comparing it with the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms.}

  abstract     = {Classic reachability games on graphs are zero-sum games, where the goal of one player, Eve, is to visit a vertex from a given target set, and that of other player, Adam, is to prevent this. Generalised reachability games, studied by Fijalkow and Horn, are a generalisation of reachability objectives, where instead of a single target set, there is a family of target sets and Eve must visit all of them in any order. In this work, we further study the complexity of solving two-player games on graphs with generalised reachability objectives. Our results are twofold: first, we provide an improved complexity picture for generalised reachability games, expanding the known tractable class from games in which all target sets are singleton to additionally allowing a logarithmic number of target sets of arbitrary size. Second, we study optimisation variants of generalised reachability with a focus on the size of the target sets. For these problems, we show intractability for most interesting cases. Particularly, in contrast to the tractability in the classic variant for singleton target sets, the optimisation problem is NP-hard when Eve tries to maximise the number of singleton target sets that are visited. Tractability can be recovered in the optimisation setting when all target sets are singleton by requiring that Eve pledges a maximum sized subset of target sets that she can guarantee to visit.}

abstract = {We introduce a new graph-theoretic concept in the area of network monitoring. In this area, one wishes to monitor the vertices and/or the edges of a network (viewed as a graph) in order to detect and prevent failures. Inspired by two notions studied in the literature (edge-geodetic sets and distance-edge-monitoring sets), we define the notion of a monitoring edge-geodetic set (MEG-set for short) of a graph G as an edge-geodetic set S⊆V(G) of G (that is, every edge of G lies on some shortest path between two vertices of S) with the additional property that for every edge e of G, there is a vertex pair x,y of S such that e lies on all shortest paths between x and y. The motivation is that, if some edge e is removed from the network (for example if it ceases to function), the monitoring probes x and y will detect the failure since the distance between them will increase. We explore the notion of MEG-sets by deriving the minimum size of a MEG-set for some basic graph classes (trees, cycles, unicyclic graphs, complete graphs, grids, hypercubes, corona products...) and we prove an upper bound using the feedback edge set of the graph. We also show that determining the smallest size of an MEG-set of a graph is NP-hard, even for graphs of maximum degree at most 9.}
