  abstract     = {Reactive computer systems bear inherent complexity due to continuous interactions with their environment. While this environment often proves to be uncontrollable, we still want to ensure that critical computer systems will not fail, no matter what they face. Examples are legion: railway traffic, power plants, plane navigation systems, etc. Formal verification of a system may ensure that it satisfies a given specification, but only applies to an already existing model of a system. In this work, we address the problem of synthesis: starting from a specification of the desired behavior, we show how to build a suitable system controller that will enforce this specification. In particular, we discuss recent developments of that approach for systems that must ensure Boolean behaviors (e.g., reachability, liveness) along with quantitative requirements over their execution (e.g., never drop out of fuel, ensure a suitable mean response time). We notably illustrate a powerful, practically useable algorithm for the automated synthesis of provably safe reactive systems.},
