  abstract     = {The window mechanism, introduced by Chatterjee et al. for mean-payoff and total-payoff objectives in two-player turn-based games on graphs, refines long-term objectives with time bounds. This mechanism has proven useful in a variety of settings, and most recently in timed systems. In the timed setting, the so-called fixed timed window parity objectives have been studied. A fixed timed window parity objective is defined with respect to some time bound and requires that, at all times, we witness a time frame, i.e., a window, of size less than the fixed bound in which the smallest priority is even. In this work, we focus on the bounded timed window parity objective. Such an objective is satisfied if there exists some bound for which the fixed objective is satisfied. The satisfaction of bounded objectives is robust to modeling choices such as constants appearing in constraints, unlike fixed objectives, for which the choice of constants may affect the satisfaction for a given bound. We show that verification of bounded timed window objectives in timed automata can be performed in polynomial space, and that timed games with these objectives can be solved in exponential time, even for multi-objective extensions. This matches the complexity classes of the fixed case. We also provide a comparison of the different variants of window parity objectives.},

  abstract     = {The window mechanism was introduced by Chatterjee et al. to reinforce mean-payoff and total-payoff objectives with time bounds in two-player turn-based games on graphs. It has since proved useful in a variety of settings, including parity objectives in games and both mean-payoff and parity objectives in Markov decision processes. We study window parity objectives in timed automata and timed games: given a bound on the window size, a path satisfies such an objective if, in all states along the path, we see a sufficiently small window in which the smallest priority is even. We show that checking that all time-divergent paths of a timed automaton satisfy such a window parity objective can be done in polynomial space, and that the corresponding timed games can be solved in exponential time. This matches the complexity class of timed parity games, while adding the ability to reason about time bounds. We also consider multi-dimensional objectives and show that the complexity class does not increase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the window mechanism in a real-time setting.},

  abstract     = {In [ABM07], Abdulla et al. introduced the concept of decisiveness, an interesting tool for lifting good properties of finite Markov chains to denumerable ones. Later, this concept was extended to more general stochastic transition systems (STSs), allowing the design of various verification algorithms for large classes of (infinite) STSs. We further improve the understanding and utility of decisiveness in two ways. First, we provide a general criterion for proving decisiveness of general STSs. This criterion, which is very natural but whose proof is rather technical, (strictly) generalizes all known criteria from the literature. Second, we focus on stochastic hybrid systems (SHSs), a stochastic extension of hybrid systems. We establish the decisiveness of a large class of SHSs and, under a few classical hypotheses from mathematical logic, we show how to decide reachability problems in this class, even though they are undecidable for general SHSs. This provides a decidable stochastic extension of o-minimal hybrid systems. [ABM07] Parosh A. Abdulla, Noomene Ben Henda, and Richard Mayr. 2007. Decisive Markov Chains. Log. Methods Comput.
