### Formal methods meet epidemic models
In collaboration with a local research group in *applied probability*, we are exploring how formal methods can help in reasoning about stochastic processes used in epidemic modeling. These particular stochastic processes are complex both due to their size (capturing huge populations) and their non-linear dynamics. Work in this direction has notably been inspired by the recent pandemic {% cite 10.1371/journal.pone.0247660 svoboda2022infection DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2402-09121 -f axis_DECIDEMIC %}. Our focus is on rich specifications and control, i.e., enabling reasoning about strategies in epidemic stochastic models.
