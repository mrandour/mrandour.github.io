I am an <a href="http://www.frs-fnrs.be/">FNRS</a> Research Associate and Professor in the <a href="https://web.umons.ac.be/fs-mathematique/">Mathematics Department</a> and <a href="https://web.umons.ac.be/complexys/en/">Complexys Institute</a> in <a href="http://www.umons.ac.be">UMONS -- Universit√© de Mons</a>, Belgium. I am currently the head of the <a href="https://web.umons.ac.be/fs-mathematique/">Mathematics Department</a>.

My work is at the crossroad between computer science and mathematics: my research interests are mainly focused on <strong>game theory</strong>, <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, <strong>formal verification</strong> and efficient and reliable controller <strong>synthesis</strong> for reactive systems.
