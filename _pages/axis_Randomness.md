### Randomness in strategies

Optimal strategies may require *randomization* (i.e., the ability to take probabilistic decisions) when dealing with inherently probabilistic goals, balancing multiple objectives, or in contexts of partial information. There are multiple ways to augment strategies (and related strategy representation models) with randomness. We study the expressive power of these different types of randomness: we notably establish a *complete taxonomy* for finite-memory strategies, valid up to multi-player games of imperfect information, in {% cite kuhn_IandC -f axis_Randomness %}. We also show that the simplest kind of randomized strategies suffice in many multi-objective problems {% cite cocktail -f axis_Randomness %}.
