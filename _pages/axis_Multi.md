### Many-sided synthesis
Historically, game-theoretic models have been focused on single-objective scenarios, where the goal of the system is either to ensure satisfaction of a *qualitative property* (e.g., avoiding unsafe states) or to *optimize a given payoff function* (e.g., minimize the energy consumption). Richer models are needed to accurately model many real-world situations: trade-offs may occur between different resources (e.g., decreasing response time requires additional computing power and energy consumption) but also between different behavioral models (e.g., average-case vs. worst-case performance). Our group develops numerous techniques and tools dedicated to such multi-objective reasoning, e.g., {% cite cocktail DBLP:journals/lmcs/BrihayeDOR20 DBLP:journals/fmsd/RandourRS17  DBLP:journals/iandc/BruyereFRR17 -f axis_Multi %}. My [FNRS project ManySynth](/projects/ManySynth/) was dedicated to this research program. See also my chapter on the subject in {% cite DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2305-10546 -f axis_Multi %}.
