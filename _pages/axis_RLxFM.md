### RL x FM
In a sense, there are two worlds: the world of *AI and learning*, which offers unparalleled efficiency but few guarantees, and the one of *logic*, which provides a fundamental framework to reason about safety, but usually lacks efficiency (as most formal methods problems have
inherently high computational complexity and thus suffer from poor scalability). Our group participates in a blooming effort to *combine the formal reasoning from logic and the power of learning* (e.g., {% cite DBLP:conf/aaai/BrazdilC0V20 -f axis_RLxFM %}). We develop techniques mixing reinforcement learning and exact methods for reactive synthesis, with a particular focus on the application contexts developed in the axes above, such as the expressive multi-objective framework of {% cite DBLP:journals/fmsd/RandourRS17 -f axis_RLxFM %}.
