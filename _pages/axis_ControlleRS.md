### Controller representations and complexity

In the game-theoretic approach toward controller synthesis, we model the interaction between a system to control and its environment as (some variation of) game between these entities, and we are looking for an appropriate (e.g., winning or optimal) strategy of the system. This strategy then constitutes a formal blueprint for a real-world controller for the system.
