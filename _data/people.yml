    James is supervised by Mickael Randour (UMONS, Belgium). His PhD is funded by the F.R.S.-FNRS. His research interests lie in the game-theoretic approach to the synthesis of controllers for reactive systems and the models used for the representation of these controllers. He is also interested in timed systems.
  interests:
    - controller representation
    - nature of randomness
    - game theory
    - memory bounds

    Luca is a teaching assistant and a PhD student from the Department of IT and Management of UMONS, Belgium, supervised by Mickael Randour and Xavier Siebert. His research focuses on the formal synthesis problem for stochastic systems evolving on continuous state-spaces. He is interested in techniques based on finite abstraction of the system or techniques mixing formal methods and learning approaches.
  interests:
    - continuous-state-space MDPs
    - reinforcement learning
    - learning with guarantees
